    <p>I lost the opportunity to have a new job, because of the pandemic situation. So I started to learn 
        the easiest "programming language", because I wanted to know more from software developing.
        The last more than one year I recruited mostly developer and test automation engineers in many fields. 
        I learned a lot from their workdays, tasks and personalities, and I like it even more! This is the reason 
        I would like to continue my career in HR.</p>
