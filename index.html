    <p>I lost the opportunity to have a new job, because of the pandemic situation. So I started to learn 
        the easiest "programming language". I wanted to know more from the developing, and I love it.
        The last more than one year I recruited mostly developer and test automation engineers in so many fields. 
        I learned a lot from their workdays, tasks and personalities, and I like it! This is the reason why I would 
        like to continue my career in HR.</p>
